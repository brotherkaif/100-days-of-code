### Day 1: Friday, Feb 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Restarted development on a pro-bono site redesign I was doing for a volunteer group I'm part of ([Coder Brixton](http://coderbrixton.com/), they're cool!). Had to put it on hold for a couple of weeks but it works out to be a good project to use for \#100DaysOfCode. 

**Thoughts**: I just finished a boot camp after leaving my job. It's safe to say that job hunting itself is a miserable pit of despair. But the one thing that actually takes my mind off it and I find enjoyment in is coding. So I figured committing to the 100 days would be a good way to fend off the blues. Also, it means that I get to improve my skillset which is great.
I also realise that I actually really like front end. I originally found it quite intimidating but the recent changes to CSS are amazing.

### Day 2: Saturday, Feb 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: More work done on the Coder Brixton site. Concentrated on getting the Vimeo embed to be responsive.

**Thoughts**: After a fair amount of frustration trying different approaches, CSS grid once again came to the rescue. The solution ended up being a 3x3 grid and placing the video in the central container. The trick to keeping the aspect ratio at 16:9 of the video was to actually use a width of 80vw and a height of 45vw (NOT vh). I managed to find this aspect ratio trick from a codepan trying to solve the same problem (but with a different implementation).

### Day 3: Sunday, Feb 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started re-designing the way quotations looked like on the site. Went for a card format that looks a lot nicer.

**Thoughts**: A fair bit of time was spent getting responsive behaviour to work correctly using `@media`. It went okay, but it did feel like trial and error at times. If anybody reading this has and advice on methodology and approaches on responsive behaviour, please reach out to me on Twitter via [@BrotherKaif](http://twitter.com/brotherkaif)!

### Day 4: Monday, Feb 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Fixed a bug with the responsive cards. Also added in some FontAwesome icons.

**Thoughts**: Fixing bugs with responsive elements is horrible. At first I attempted to redo the entire card only to totally revert back to what I had originally and just tweak it slightly. Lesson learned, it's not worth tearing it all down just to resolve an edge case that can be fixed with minor tweaks. Also added in some Font Awesome icons, because who doesn't like Font Awesome?!

### Day 5: Tuesday, Feb 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: A bit more work on styling the rest of the sections.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have a huge amount of time to code today so tackled some of the low hanging fruit of marking up the sections. Also started a project kanban on GitHub to start keeping track of the tasks that still need to be done.
