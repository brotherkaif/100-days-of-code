### Day 1: Friday, Feb 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Restarted development on a pro-bono site redesign I was doing for a volunteer group I'm part of ([Coder Brixton](http://coderbrixton.com/), they're cool!). Had to put it on hold for a couple of weeks but it works out to be a good project to use for \#100DaysOfCode. 

**Thoughts**: I just finished a boot camp after leaving my job. It's safe to say that job hunting itself is a miserable pit of despair. But the one thing that actually takes my mind off it and I find enjoyment in is coding. So I figured committing to the 100 days would be a good way to fend off the blues. Also, it means that I get to improve my skillset which is great.
I also realise that I actually really like front end. I originally found it quite intimidating but the recent changes to CSS are amazing.
